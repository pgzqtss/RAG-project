        "P1.2": "This research paper details a thorough evaluation of various studies in relation to a specific research question. The researchers identified studies using a methodologically-based score system with low risk being studies with one or no methodological issues or limitation, medium risk being two to three items, and high risk being more than three items. While initially starting with 2247 potentially relevant citations, after rigorous elimination processes which included removal of duplicates and checking against predetermined criteria, the shortlist was whittled down to a total of seven studies for final review.\n\nThe reviewed studies primarily focused on Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) and their efficiency in reducing the transmission of the influenza virus. These studies were drawn from a variety of settings, employed different interventions, and used different outcome measures. The three main categories of NPI identified in the studies were disinfection and hygiene, barriers, and combined NPI. The primary outcome of interest was evidence of decreased transmission of the influenza virus, which was measured in terms of reduction in influenza or Influenza-like Illness (ILI) rates, changes in secondary infection ratios, alterations in viral illness severity, changes in mortality rates, and healthcare utilization.\n\nThe researchers concluded that although these seven studies met all selection criteria, they nonetheless showcased significant design flaws, including poor statistical power. Only two of the studies used laboratory-confirmed influenza as an outcome measure. Despite these issues, interventions that indicated some positive significance included professional oral hygiene in the elderly and hand washing, which implied some potential for NPI in preventing influenza transmission. However, the data is extremely limited, compelling the need for further research in the field."

    "review": "- Background: The systematic review focused on analyzing various researches connected to a specific research question. Primarily, the focus was laid on evaluating the efficiency of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) in reducing the transmission of the influenza virus. The researchers began with 2247 potentially relevant studies and, through numerous eliminations, narrowed it down to seven.\n\n- Methods: The studies were selected and identified through a methodological score system. This system classified studies based on risk, with low risk being studies carrying one or no methodological issues or limitations, medium risk being two to three items, and high risk being more than three. This process enabled the shortlisting of the most relevant studies from a vast pool. The studies selected for review encompassed various settings, interventions, and outcome measures for better comprehensive coverage. Two main methods of checking the effectiveness of NPI included laboratory-confirmed influenza, and other outcome variables such as changes in secondary infection ratios, alterations in viral illness severity, changes in mortality rates, and healthcare utilization.\n\n- Results: The studies zeroed in on three primary categories of NPI: disinfection and hygiene, barriers, and combined NPI. Despite some limitations, certain interventions yielded positive results indicating the potential effectiveness of NPI in curbing influenza transmission. These interventions included professional oral hygiene for the elderly and hand washing.\n\n- Conclusions: The systematic review revealed significant design flaws in the studies such as poor statistical power, which calls for deeper and more rigorous research in the future. However, positive results from certain methods suggest a potential for NPI in preventing influenza transmission. These findings indicate the necessity for a comprehensive exploration of NPI strategies to combat the spreading of influenza."
